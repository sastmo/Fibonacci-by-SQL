# SQL-toolkit

As a data-driven Business Analyst, you need SQL queries more than anything.
In addition, Recursive Query and  PLpgSQL allow you to perform more advanced analysis.
In this repository, three Recursive Query has presented:

# Fibonacci-by-RECURSIVE SQL:
A recursive query can only be recalled once within itself, resulting in limitations in some cases.
Consequently, we must use a non-linear recursive query to overcome this limitation. 
In order to give an idea of how you can recall a query inside itself as much as you like, the Fibonacci series has been written as an example of a non-linear recursive query.

# K_mean: 
The K-mean clustering method is so handy and could be written in SQL. 
I have used it for a number of my projects. We can cluster large amounts of data using this SQL algorithm very quickly.

# Recursive Text Processing based on Finite State Machine (FSM):
PostgreSQL's regular expression library is a powerful tool for cleaning and processing data.
Using SQL, we can define a text-processing function without using PostgreSQL regex. 
This gives us more control over the defined process. 
In order to do this, we need to translate the considered regular expression into a deterministic Finite State Machine (FSM) within a table;
next, we write a recursive query to process the text.
